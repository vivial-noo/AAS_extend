These industrial assets, such as production lines, modules, infrastructure elements, and subsystems, are provided by value chain partners such as suppliers, equipment manufacturers, and system integrators. They are utilized in specific applications by industrial operators and end users. \nA Service Request Notification is a request for a service to be performed, such as a maintenance, an inspection, or a return. The notification entry can be made by Asset Administration Shell (AAS), via a service dashboard, service portal or even through the customer service department by phone. \nThe Service Request Notification can be considered as a \"call for help\", which, if the business partner responds to it, triggers the further service process. \nThe objective of the Submodel template is to define and standardize the Service Request Notification, including   its content (properties, operations, etc.) and structure. Additionally, service types are defined. \nThe objective of this Submodel is to enable the interoperable exchange of these notifications between Asset Administration Shells, and the IT systems of various value creation partners.",

Based on this information, it is possible to initiate a connection to \nsuch kind of service and start to request or subscribe to served datapoints, and/or perform operations. Such \ndatapoints of a system service can be, for example, various sensor and/or status values, and an operation \ncan trigger an actuator, such as switching a motor “on” or “off”.\nThe Asset Interfaces Description (AID) in version 1.0 supports the description of interfaces based on three \nspecific protocols: Modbus, HTTP and MQTT. Any other protocols and interfaces will be addressed in \nupcoming versions of the AID. As a forward-looking note, the AID working group at IDTA has outlined plans \nfor the AID 1.1 version to incorporate support for both OPC UA (joint activity with the OPC Foundation) and \nBACnet.\nThe W3C Web of Things Thing Description (WoT TD) as an open, royalty-free standard is considered as a \nbaseline for the content and structure of the definition of this Submodel template.\nIn addition to the protocol specific information provided by the AID, it also provides the ability to reference \nexternal descriptors such as GSD, GSDML, IO Device Description, WoT TD (as a supplement) etc. These \nexternal descriptor is not restricted to the protocols currently defined in the AID.\nAs a complement to the AID, an Asset Interfaces Mapping Configuration (AIMC) Submodel can be used to \nmap the received data from the asset services to a specific place within an AAS (e.g. an application specific \nSubmodel to monitor data). The principle scope and use of the AID Submodel in combination with an AIMC \nis explained in the following figure:\n![image](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/submodel-templates/assets/93717810/02879e8f-8028-47d0-be8c-fcb3d6395457)",

Industrial \nequipment can be composed of subsystems down to material and component level, can include produced \nproducts and can be described on type or instance level.\nThe AAS contains Submodels that cover aspects of the assets among their life cycle. Already in the design \nphase, assets are composed and aggregated into newly created hierarchical structures. \nTypically, assets have their own AAS (Entity with entityType “SelfManagedEntity\"), but it is possible that an \nAsset has no AAS and is represented by a co-managed Entity.\nSince nesting of AAS and Submodels is forbidden by the metamodel, this Submodel is intended to provide a \ndescription of the internal structure of an asset. It shall allow the consumer of an AAS to identify assets and \ntheir corresponding entities and find their respective AAS if they exist.

In the past, the postal address or a simple location description (e.g., hall B, aisle 3) or a GNSS \ncoordinate (Global Navigation Satellite System, like GPS) was sufficient as location information for \ncontrolling logistics processes. \nWith the increasing propagation of localization technologies such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB), BLE (Bluetooth \nLow Energy), RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) and others, the continuous and precise tracking of \nobjects becomes possible at reasonable costs. This opens up new possibilities for the automation, \nmonitoring and analysis of goods flows and internal transportation tasks. It is also possible to measure \nmasses of localization data for short distances within buildings, which is why the integration of a localization \nsolution into warehouse systems or production lines is becoming increasingly popular. The systems for \nlocalization are usually referred to as real-time location systems (RTLS).\nAutomated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous transport robots with free navigation (AGVs) are also \nincreasingly being used for internal transportation tasks. These are another driver for the use of localization \ntechnologies in companies.\nLocation data for assets are determined by different localization systems during the life cycle and even at the \nsame point in time more than one system can deliver a location information. Today location data originate \nfrom a variety of non-interoperable systems, for which the data model for the localization information is not \nstandardized.\nSince asset location data are generated and used by different systems, for different use cases, in different \nlife cycle phases and by different organizations it makes particular sense to manage the location data in the \nAAS of an asset in the form of a standardized Submodel.",

With the growing penetration of production with AGVs, these will also take on very specific transport, handling and, with the right setup, possibly also assembly or manufacturing tasks. \nIn this specification AGV is used as generic term for all driverless vehicles and robots in intralogistics. This Submodel supports all kinds of driverless vehicles like AMR or guided FTF.\nSuppliers of AGVs will continue to develop specific capabilities and features for their vehicles and possible attachments. This will inevitably lead to the situation where different types of vehicles and vehicles from different manufacturers have to be operated in one production environment. These mixed fleets have to be integrated in the overall driverless transportation system and controlled via a central or decentral control system. In most cases this control system will be linked to the ERP or MES system where it is receiving the transportation orders from. Control systems can be proprietary systems of the vehicle supplier or manufacturer-independent systems. With increasingly mixed fleets in operation manufacturer-independent control systems will be more widespread on the market.\nAgainst this background, a digital twin in the form of an AAS for the vehicles is to form the data basis for the integration of the individual vehicles into an overall system. The Submodel \"Technical Data for Automated Guided Vehicles in Intralogistics\" aims to identify the necessary information for integration and standardize it with an AAS Submodel specification.

The scope of this Submodel is to increase the interoperability between the parties that are exchanging asset documentation.

In case a machine manufacturer sells a machine to a customer (operator), the manufacturer hands over the machine and its documentation in form of an AAS with the Submodel “Handover Documentation”. The documents provided can contain information required for e.g. correct design, installation, commissioning, spare parts stocking, operation, cleaning, inspection, maintenance, and repair. In addition, there are legal regulations that stipulate the existence of certain manufacturer documents, such as Communauté Européenne (CE) declarations of conformity, Atmosphères Explosives (ATEX) certificates, or material certificates.\nBesides the structure of a Submodel and the exchange format of an AAS, this Submodel standardizes the meta data that comes with the asset documentation and the classes that classify the type of the document. With these standardized meta data and classes, the asset documentation can be automatically integrated in the customer’s document management system, backend system, or any other system.\nThe meta data as well as the classification classes of this Submodel are based on the VDI Guideline VDI 2770 Blatt 1 “Operation of process engineering plants – Minimum requirements for digital manufacturer information for the process industry” [7].

    "title": "DEXPI",
    "scope": "The engineering of a process plant is a complex multi-disciplinary and multi-organizational process involving exchange of a vast number of (semi-)standardized artifacts like diagrams, drawings, tables, certificates, and other documents. \nOne core artifact which is created and extended during the engineering process is the Piping & Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) providing among others a good balance of abstraction between the physical layout of the plant (i.e., used equipment and piping connections) and its representation within the automation domain (i.e., signal types, tag names, logical connections between sensor and actuators). Due to this fact P&IDs are long-living artifacts which are frequently used during the whole plant’s lifecycle beyond the engineering phase [7]. \nEven though most engineering artifacts are created digitally, they are not necessarily exchanged in a machine-readable format. The lack of a machine-readable representation of engineering artifacts (including P&IDs) hinders the digital transformation and can be a showstopper for digital use-cases due to high costs of creation of a machine-readable P&ID representation.\nEfforts to create a standardized machine-readable exchange format for P&ID are made by the DEXPI working group of DECHEMA including operators from multiple verticals (e.g., Oil and Gas, and Chemistry), engineering companies, software tool vendors and research institutes. DEXPI [8] is an UML-Model implemented using an XML-based P&ID exchange format including multiple aspects of plant design like piping topology and its graphical representation, instrumentation structure, tag names. DEXPI is an open industrial standard aiming for a broad usage across industrial domains.\nDue to the paramount role of P&ID during the whole plant’s lifecycle, the importance of DEXPI has been identified by the Industry 4.0 community. Inclusion of DEXPI models into a standardized lifecycle information container – the Industry 4.0 Asset Administration Shell (AAS) – would facilitate links between different disciplines, organizations and industry domains. Mapping of DEXPI models to the AAS by defining an AAS Submodel template is governed by Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA) where a respective working group was founded in 2022. The group consists of representatives of the DEXPI working group, oil and gas industry, engineering and procurement companies, automation equipment suppliers, and research institutes.",
